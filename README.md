# **Flask LDAP Address Book**

This is a production-ready, configurable web application that serves as an online address book for an LDAP directory. It's built with Python 3, Flask, and Bootstrap.

The application allows users to browse, search, add, edit and view contact and company information from an LDAP server in a clean, fast, and user-friendly interface.

* **Search & Filtering**: Full-text search for contacts and alphabetical filtering for both contacts and companies.
* **Admin Panel**: A simple user management interface for local and ldap accounts.

## **Performance & Caching**

A major challenge with LDAP directories is that querying a large list of users can be slow. To ensure a fast and responsive user experience, this application implements a **server-side caching** mechanism which refreshes the cache at configurable intervals.

### **How It Works**

A scheduled background job runs at a configured interval. This job refreshes the cache, the web ui will query the cache at all times, this significantly speeds up the user experience and reduces the load on your ldap server.

When adding or editing contacts through the web ui a single background job is scheduled to run immediately so that saved changes are available right away.

## **Screenshots**

Here are a few examples of the application's interface.
